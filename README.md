# Algorithm Implementations in C#

**Language:** C# | 
**Institution:** Óbuda University (John von Neumann Faculty of Informatics)

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of fundamental algorithms and data structures implemented in C#. I created this project during my studies at Óbuda University to practice the transition from theoretical concepts to practical software development.

As a student focused on academic precision and high-quality results, my goal was to write code that is clean, well-documented, and efficient.

## Key Features

* **Data Structures:** Implementation of Lists, Stacks, and Queues (both array and linked versions), Binary Search Trees, Hash Tables with overflow areas, and Heaps.
* **Graph Algorithms:** Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
* **Minimum Spanning Trees:** Implementation of Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms.
* **Sorting:** Heap Sort implementation.
* **Optimization (Knapsack Problem):** Solutions using Brute Force, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, and Branch and Bound techniques.
* **Programming Paradigms:** Application of Imperative, Functional, and Object-Oriented paradigms.

## Technologies

* **Language:** C# (.NET 8.0)
* **Tools:** Visual Studio, Git
* **Testing:** Unit tests using NUnit framework

## My Approach

In this project, I focused on:
* **Precision:** Ensuring every implementation is robust and efficient, reflecting my strong academic record.
* **Complexity Analysis:** Understanding time and space complexity (Big O notation) for each algorithm.
* **Growth:** Using these foundations as a stepping stone toward my long-term interest in Big Data.
